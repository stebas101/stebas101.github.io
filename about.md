Welcome to my blog! My name is Stefano Basurto, and I'm passionate about using data analysis, machine learning and visualization to uncover insights on business, investments and the world around us.

Join me as I share my journey through Data Science, Python, and all things related to data technologies. I hope you'll find useful information and inspiration here.

With a previous experience in financial services and investment research, I bring a strategic approach to using data for decision-making. My tech stack includes Python, SQL, and tools like pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. I'm also fascinated by data visualization and skilled in programming languages like Java and JavaScript.

I received a _laurea magistrale_ degree in Economics from Bocconi University (Milan, Italy). I am currently a CFA Charterholder and member of the [CFA Institute](https://www.cfainstitute.org).
