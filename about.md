## Turning data into insight with code

My name is Stefano Basurto, and I am passionate about building solutions to access, visualise and get insights from data.

I embraced Python as my main programming language over a decade ago and have since used it extensively to craft solutions for data analysis, machine learning and web development. Alongside Python, I code in JavaScript, Java and R, and have strong experience with databases, including SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) and _object-relational mapping_ (ORM).

More recently, Iâ€™ve focused on backend development, leveraging frameworks like Flask and integrating cloud technologies for scalable deployments on Linux systems and cloud platforms.

Before transitioning into software development, I worked as an investment research analyst in the financial services industry. I earned the CFA charterholder qualification and matured knowledge that can give me a strong edge with financial data and fintech products.

As an enthusiastic lifelong learner, I am always eager to keep abreast of the latest technological developments and ready to apply them to create cutting-edge products.
