My name is Stefano Basurto and I am an Investment Researcher based in London, UK.

I am a lifelong learner and passionate about finding new ways to apply data science techniques to make investment decisions, study financial and economic data and develop insights on our world.

This website is my blog where I plan to share some of my work with you. I hope you find it useful.

I received a _laurea magistrale_ degree in Economics (Monetary and Financial Economics) from Bocconi University (Milan, Italy). I am currently a CFA Charterholder, member of the [CFA Institute](https://www.cfainstitute.org) and Full Member of the [Society of Technical Analysts](https://www.sta-uk.org/) in the UK.
