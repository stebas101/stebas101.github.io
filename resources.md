## Computer Programming in Python

#### **Free** Books

- **Think Python**  
by Allen B. Downey  
Green Tea Press   
-----  
This book is one of the best introduction to Python programming for complete beginners that I've found. The basic concepts are explained very clearly, and there's plenty of programming exercises for practice. Available in PDF and HTML on the [Green Tea Press website](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/){:target="_blank"}. Check out the other free titles from the same author (*Think Bayes*, *Think Stats*, *Think Java* and more).

- **Python for Everybody**  
by Charles Severance  
-----  
Another excellent introduction for people new to programming. It serves a textbook for courses available on Coursera, edX, FutureLearn and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DvywoWv6fI){:target="_blank"}. I didn't actually use this book when I had to learn Python from scratch since I found out only recently, but I think it's worth adding to the list. It can be downloaded from the [author's website](http://pythonlearn.com/){:target="_blank"}. Also available online on [Trinket](https://books.trinket.io/pfe/index.html){:target="_blank"}.  

- **Automate the boring stuff with Python**   
by Al Sweigart  
No Starch Press  
-----  
This is a go-to book after you've mastered the basics of the language. It offers coding practice with interesting examples like sending email, manipulating files, web scraping, automating spreadsheets and image processing. There's a free HTML version on the book's website: [automatetheboringstuff.com](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/){:target="_blank"}. More free Python books from the same author on: [inventwithpython.com](https://inventwithpython.com/){:target="_blank"}.

#### Other Books (non-free)

- **Python for Data Analysis**  
by Wes McKinney  
2017, O'Reilly  
-----  
The *pandas* library is what makes Python a data analysis powerhouse and this title is written by the creator of *pandas* himself.  
I used the second edition of this book. However, in my opinion, it's already outdated: that's how fast this library has evolved since the book's publication. In any case, I still have to find a better resource to learn *pandas* in detail.  A third edition is on the way, and I would wait for that if I had to purchase a copy now.  

- **Learning SQL: Generate, Manipulate, and Retrieve Data**  
by Alan Beaulieu  
2020, O'Reilly  
-----  
Data scientist are often required to use SQL to handle large datasets.  
This text is not for absolute beginners, but it's still one of the best resources to master the power of SQL. I used the second edition of this book to to get my grips on SQL years ago, and I keep going back to it when I need to refresh my knowledge.  

#### Python MOOCs

There are a several online courses that can help to set some foundations of coding with Python if you, like me, don't come from a computing background. Here are some that I liked most.

The next two courses are part of the [Computational Thinking using Python](https://www.edx.org/xseries/mitx-computational-thinking-using-python){:target="_blank"} program by MIT on edX:

- [**Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python**](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7){:target="_blank"}

- [**Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science**](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-4){:target="_blank"}

Another good one:

- [**Using Python for Research**](https://www.edx.org/course/using-python-for-research){:target="_blank"}  
by Harvard University on edX.

## Statistics

#### **Free** Books

- [**Introduction to Modern Statistics**](https://www.openintro.org/book/ims/){:target="_blank"}  
by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Johanna Hardin

- [**OpenIntro Statistics**](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/){:target="_blank"}  
by David Diez, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Christopher Barr  
-----  
Both books can be downladed for free from [OpenIntro](https://www.openintro.org/){:target="_blank"}.

## Mathematics

#### **Free** Books

- **Mathematics for Machine Learning**  
by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong  
2020, Cambridge University Press  
-----  
Not a text for beginners, since it requires some solid foundations of Calculus and Linear Algebra. It can be downloaded for free on [mml-book.github.io/](https://mml-book.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.

- **Introduction to Probability for Data Science**  
by Stanley Chan  
2021, Michigan Publishing  
-----  
Read for free on [probability4datascience.com/](https://probability4datascience.com/){:target="_blank"}, or download the free PDF from [Michigan Publishing](https://services.publishing.umich.edu/publications/ee/){:target="_blank"}.

## Machine Learning

#### **Free** Books

- **An Introduction to Statistical Learning (with applications in R)**  
by G. James, D. Witten, T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani  
Springer Verlag  
-----  
One of the best books around on Statistical Learning. It can be downloaded for free onfrom its web page [www.statlearning.com](https://www.statlearning.com/){:target="_blank"} or from [trevorhastie.github.io/ISLR/](https://trevorhastie.github.io/ISLR/){:target="_blank"}.  

#### Other Books (non-free)  

- **Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow**  
by Aurélien Géron  
2019, O'Reilly  
-----  
At the time of writing, I have just started with this title: I wish I had done this earlier! Beautifully and clearly written, it covers the most relevant Machine Learning topics from an applied point of view with just the right amount of theory.

#### **Free** Online Learning

- [fast.ai](https://fast.ai){:target="_blank"}
Check out their free **Practical Deep Learning** course.

- [Google’s Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course){:target="_blank"}

- Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning){:target="_blank"}  
Probably the most popular MOOCs on machine learning.

## Data Science Online Learning Platforms

- [**DataCamp**](https://www.datacamp.com/){:target="_blank"}  

- [**Dataquest**](https://app.dataquest.io/referral-signup/wvx96mix/){:target="_blank"}  
So far, my favourite learning platform. It does not use videos, rather just clearly written text and exercises, which I pefer. *The link above contains a referral link,  it should give you $15 off if you sign up.*

- [**365DataScience**](https://365datascience.com/){:target="_blank"}
