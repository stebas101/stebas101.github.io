Matplotlib enables Python users to create beautiful and publication quality data visualizations. However, the capability to create OHLC and candlestick charts has so far been limited. The *mpl-finance* library, the Matplotlib component that takes care of drawing those charts, had been deprecated and relegated to a separate and, until recently, neglected package.

If you, like me, are interested in using Matplotlib to create charts to study financial markets, you have reasons to be happy: mpl-finance has now a new maintainer, [Daniel Goldfarb](https://github.com/DanielGoldfarb), and a new revamped version is going to be released soon at the beginning of 2020.

The API of the current *mpl-finance* library is, to be frank, quite cumbersome. It does not integrate quite well with the *pandas* data analysis framework, and creating a bar chart requires some data manipulation.

The new version will change all this. It can be previewed by cloning the Github repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/matplotlib/mplfinance
```
or by downloading the repository if you're not using Git: [https://github.com/matplotlib/mplfinance/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/matplotlib/mplfinance/archive/master.zip)

To install the library make sure you `cd` into it to make it your working directory (it should contain *setup.py*), then run:
```
pip install mplfinance .
```
Note the '.' (dot) at the end of the instruction. It can then by imported as:
```
import mplfinance as mpf
```
Note that the name has now no '_' nor '-' in it compared to the previous version.

After loading our data in a `data` *pandas* dataframe with Open, High, Low and Close columns, creating a bar chart is as easy as typing:
```
mpf.plot(data, no_xgaps = True)
```

which produces a chart like the following:

Candlestick charts look good too:
```
mpf.plot(data, type='candlestick', no_xgaps = True)
```

As you might have noticed, *mplfinance* can now remove the gaps generated by non-trading days like weekends and public holidays (by using the `no-xgaps` option), something that in the current version requires some not-so-straightforward data manipulation.

I am definitely looking forward to seeing the new version released soon.
