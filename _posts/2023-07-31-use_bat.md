Three handy CLI tools for Linux and macOS: *bat*, *tldr* and *neofetch*
------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a Linux and macOs command line interface user, I just came across three simple tools that
I wished I had found earlier.

If you, like me, need to quickly peek inside the content of a text file within the *bash* (or *zsh*) shell, you will most probably use the **cat** command. There's a better way to do this.

bat vs cat
----------
The **cat** command stands for *concatenation* and that's what it was designed for: to concatenate strings and text files. And it does quite a [good job](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-cat-command-in-linux-concatenation-explained-with-bash-examples/) at that.
However, it has found greater success and worldwide fame as a tool for inspecting the content of a text file by speedy typing into the terminal shell.

As an example, to check instantly the content of a script I can type:

```
$ cat merge_sort.py
```

and get:

![cat output](/assets/images/batpost_cat_output.png)

If, instead, I use **bat**:

```
$ bat merge_sort.py
```

I get the following output:

![bat output](/assets/images/batpost_bat_output.png)

Which one is more pleasant and easier to read? That's right: *bat* formats the text in a clear and visually pleasant way by including line numbers, syntax highlighting and pagination.

*bat* did not come preinstalled with my macOS. I installed it using [Homebrew]():

```
$ brew install bat
```

On Linux, the following should work (Ubuntu and Debian-like distributions):
```
$ sudo apt install bat
```

tldr vs man
-----------

What do you do when you need to know how to use a specific shell 
command? I bet you call the **man**!

Here is another time saver: by using **tldr** instead of *man* you get more streamlined 
and clear information.

Check this out and compare:
```
$ man ls
```
which ouputs:
![man output](/assets/images/batpost_man_output.png)

instead, *tldr* gets:

```
$ tldr ls
```
![tldr output](/assets/images/batpost_tldr_output.png)

The content provided by the two commands is different: *man* generates the whole manual pages with descriptions, options, and so on. *tldr*, on the other hand, provides only some essential information. Which, in the vast majority of the cases, is all you need. This tool is an ongoing project: more on the [tldr's website](https://tldr.sh/).

Again, *tldr* was not included with my macOs installation. To install it using [Homebrew]():

```
$ brew install tldr
```

On Linux, use this (Ubuntu and Debian-like distributions):
```
$ sudo apt install tldr
```

neofetch
--------

This is a straightforward little tool. To see what it does, just type in your terminal:

```
$ neofetch
```

You should get something like this:

![neofetch output](/assets/images/batpost_neofetch_output.png)

That’s what it does: it provides a screenshot of your system alongside your operating system’s logo. And, yes, I tested it by connecting remotely to a tiny RaspberryPi Zero machine: one of the cutest little computers ever. That shows how *neofetch* can be useful: there are situations when we need to provide system information to other people (for troubleshooting or other operations.) With *neofetch* we can instantly generate that information, copy, paste and forward to whoever needs it.

To install it on macOs:
```
$ brew install neofetch
```

And on Linux (Ubuntu and Debian-like distributions):
```
$ sudo apt install neofetch
```

I hope you enjoyed this post and find those tools useful!
